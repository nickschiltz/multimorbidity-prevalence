# multimorbidity-prevalence
Code for analysis of multimorbidity combinations in the MEPS data using association rule mining

Final "unclean" version of the code posted. This has all of the code for the manuscript, including different versions of tables and figures that were not presented. I plan to make a final clean version using R Markdown in the near future, once final paper is accepted.

arules_prev_1619.R - has all of the data for the analysis
primcare_rel_classify icd10 v2.sas - has the data pre-processing steps
